# 🌱 AI-Powered Crop Disease Detector 🚀

## 🌟 Introduction
Welcome to the **AI-Powered Crop Disease Detector**! 🧠🌿 This project utilizes **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to analyze plant leaf images and detect diseases. It aims to assist farmers and agricultural experts in identifying crop diseases early and accurately. 🌾🔍

## ✨ Features
- 📸 **Image-Based Detection** – Upload an image of a leaf, and the model will predict the disease.
- 🏷️ **Multi-Class Classification** – Identifies various crop diseases.
- 📊 **Real-Time Predictions** – Provides instant results using a trained deep learning model.
- 📈 **High Accuracy** – Built using CNN architectures like **VGG16, ResNet50, or MobileNet**.
- 🖥️ **User-Friendly Interface** – (Optional) Deploy using **Flask/FastAPI & Streamlit**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍
- **Deep Learning Framework:** TensorFlow / PyTorch 🧠
- **Image Processing:** OpenCV 📷
- **Web Framework (Optional):** Flask / FastAPI 🌐
- **Dataset:** PlantVillage 📊

## 📥 Dataset
We use the **PlantVillage dataset**, which contains images of healthy and diseased leaves for various crops. You can download it from:
[🌍 PlantVillage Dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/plant_village)


## 📌 How to Use
1. Run the app using Flask or Streamlit:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
2. Upload an image of a plant leaf. 🌿
3. Get instant results on whether the leaf is **healthy** or **infected**. ✅❌

## 🏗️ Model Architecture
The model is built using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** such as:
- ✅ **VGG16**
- ✅ **ResNet50**
- ✅ **MobileNetV2**
- ✅ **EfficientNet**

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- ✅ Enhance accuracy using **Transfer Learning**.
- ✅ Expand dataset to include more plant species. 🌍
- ✅ Deploy on **Cloud** for mobile accessibility. ☁️📱
- ✅ Create an **Android App** for real-time disease detection. 📲
